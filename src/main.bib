title = {UPCluster-SZ: The Updated Catalog of Galaxy Clusters from the List of Planck Sunyaev–Zel’dovich Sources},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {We present the updated galaxy cluster catalog of the second Planck catalog of Sunyaev–Zel’dovich sources (PSZ2) through the compilation of the data for clusters and galaxies with spectroscopically measured redshifts in the literature. The original version of PSZ2 comprises 1653 Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) sources, of which 1203 have been validated as genuine galaxy clusters, while the remaining 450 sources are yet to be validated. To increase the number of genuine clusters in PSZ2, we first update the validations of the cluster candidates and their redshift information using the data compiled for the confirmed clusters and the member galaxies in the literature. We then use the galaxy redshift data in the fields of the remaining cluster candidates by searching for possible member galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts around the SZ centroids. In this search process, we classify clusters as strong candidates if they contain more than nine galaxies within a 4500 km s−1 velocity range and within 15′ around the SZ centroids. This process results in the validation of 139 new genuine clusters, the update of redshift information on 399 clusters, and the identification of 10 strong candidates, which increases the number of validated clusters up to 1334 among the 1653 SZ sources. Our updated galaxy cluster catalog will be very useful for studies of galaxy formation and cosmology through a combination with other all-sky surveys including the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and SPHEREx.}
